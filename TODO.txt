- Override the workflow history viewlet to show info for all workflows
  and not just the main workflow, something like this should do it:

    workflows = workflow.getWorkflowsFor(self.context)
    review_history = []
    for wf in workflows:
        try:
            history = workflow.getInfoFor(
                self.context,
                'review_history',
                wf_id=wf.id)
            review_history.extend(history)
        except KeyError:
            # doesn't have the 'review_history' variable
            pass

- Write tests
- Look back into folder_contents setup to make sure it overrides only
  the necessary pieces
